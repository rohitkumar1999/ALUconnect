   It allows alumni to interact with the current students,college teachers and other staff members. An alumni can share his experience with the students,share assignments and other important link. 
  ## How Someone can use our Application
 First and the moremost thing is that no one cann just comeup and login/Register in our Application.So what is going to 
 happen ?
 The college representative will come to our website and register for the college and then an autogenrated mail will be sent to the representative that will ask further details of the college and the after proper manual verification by ourself we will assign an college id for the respective college and then students can register into our application by only using that college id.
  ## What is  the benefit of the  institution in registering into our system ?
   1. Well managed database 
   2. Institute can easily message the new event which is gonna happen in college. 
   3. Easy searching in data base 
   4. It allows Alumni to connect with the college and college have a maintained data  of all the Alumni which they  can search using our Application by these following ways <br />
